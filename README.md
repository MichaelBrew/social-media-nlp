# NLP for Social Media

The goal of this project is to apply sentiment analysis and more general NLP tools to social media posts. The current web interface uses the Facebook API to authenticate a given user's account, fetch their recent wall posts, and display the analyzed sentiment of each post.

The next step is integrating Twitter's Stream API to fetch real-time tweets and track generalized sentiment for a given keyword, hashtag, or user mention over a much larger dataset.
